# LiquidNFT

Making NFTs liquid. Enabling people to buy fractions of NFT. Being able to invest just a few cents while still being exposed to an NFT collection price.

How to use this repo:

This repo uses hardhat, just clone it and edit the config file. Then use basic hardhat commands to compile, test, run the smart contracts.

The deployer is available on Optimism:
mainnet: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x506bc01c73664006e114a392e4623fb10ec29d77#code 
testnets: https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb994b82754a36b22d766bf66c615070f03d90726#code

If the contracts don't automatically include the source code, check out the "verifying your contracts" on the hardhat documentation.
